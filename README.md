# Search_Engine_Benefits

## My Tasks

I was given the task to review the code and make the necessary changes to:

1. Make all links operational
1. Add alt text to images for accesibility users
1. Optimize CSS so the site has better search optimization
1. Apply HTML Semantics
1. Make sure all headings are in order

### My Changes

I began by reviewing the orignal code and realized that no HTML semantics were being used. I changed the document up so that it followed html semantics and structure even before CSS appliation.

<br></br>

I went ahead and added the necessary semantics like header, section, aside and footer. This was necessary to make the HTML easier to read and follow. This also emphazises the structure of the document. Furthermore, I added a unique ID to ones of the links that was broken so that it could work properly. To fully complete my review, I also added the alt attributes to add an explanation of the images for people with accesibility needs.

I also changed up the orignal css, because it was not optimized and made the website load slower.

Most of the CSS was good, but there were some classes that were overused to tag specific sections. Since they shared the same formatting I simply created one unique class tag and left only one css class tag. This didn't break the code and it allowed the page to be more optimized so that it could load better and so that it could have better search engine optimization. 

Thank you for taking taking the time to take a look at my code and visit this site!
